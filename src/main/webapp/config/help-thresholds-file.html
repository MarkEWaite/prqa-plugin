    <h3>File Compliance Index</h3>
    <p>This is the mean across all files of the percentage of message groups (a coding standard "rule") for
        which there are no messages in each file. </p>

    <p>A high File Compliance Index and low Project Compliance Index indicates that each file violates only a small
        number of rules but each file violates a different rule.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the Compliance Indices are close then each file is violating more or less the same rules.
