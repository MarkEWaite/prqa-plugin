	<h3>Thresholds</h3>
    <p>For each data field a <i>Threshold</i> or <i>Improvement</i> can be set:</p>
    <ul>
	    <li><i>Threshold</i> indicates that the build must have less or equal messages than the value specified or the build will be marked as unstable.</li>
	    <li><i>Improvement</i> indicates that the amount of messages must be less or equal to the number of messages found in previous build or the build will be marked as unstable.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
    The default value <i>None</i> means that this field is ignored, so it can have any value without affecting the build stability.
    Threshold levels are displayed on the trending graphs.
	</p>
	<h4>Threshold Level</h4>
	<p>
	This sets the message level from which the message total is calculated. Only messages from this level and
above are summed to give the message total which is used for the Messages Threshold comparison.
Note that Compliance Index thresholds are not affected by this setting.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that you can have thresholds set on more than one item - if <i>any</i> of the data fields fall below their threshold then the build will be marked as unstable.
    </p>
