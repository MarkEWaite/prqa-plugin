	<h3>Thresholds</h3>
    <p>For each data field a <i>Threshold</i> or <i>Improvement</i> can be set:</p>
    <ul>
	    <li><i>Threshold</i> indicates that the build must have less or equal messages than the value specified or the build will be marked as unstable.</li>
	    <li><i>Improvement</i> indicates that the amount of messages must be less or equal to the number of messages found in previous build or the build will be marked as unstable.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
    The default value <i>None</i> means that this field is ignored, so it can have any value without affecting the build stability.
    Threshold levels are displayed on the trending graphs.
	</p>
    <p>
        Note that you can have thresholds set on more than one item - if <i>any</i> of the data fields fall below their threshold then the build will be marked as unstable.
